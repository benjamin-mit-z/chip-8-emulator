This is a chip-8 emulator following mostly this https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/ guide. The easiest improvement would be to implement a proper mechanic to pace execution but i cant be asked.
This implements all functionalities of the original chip-8. Becaus of this some newer games use unknown instructions.\
Usage: cargo run -- binary\
Rust is pretty cool!
